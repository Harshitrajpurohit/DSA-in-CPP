# **Data Structures and Algorithms in C++**

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++, aimed at providing a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing fundamental concepts in computer science.

## **Contents:**

### **Sorting Algorithms:**
Various sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort for sorting arrays.

### **Linked List:**
Implementation of singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### **Priority Queue:**
Implementation of a priority queue data structure using heaps with functionalities like insertion, deletion, and heap operations.

### **Stack and Queue:**
Implementation of stack and queue data structures with basic operations like push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

### **Tower of Hanoi:**
Recursive implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem with explanation and demonstration.

### **Tree:**
Implementation of different tree data structures such as binary tree, binary search tree.

### **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
Implementation of a binary search tree data structure with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.


Each directory contains a C++ file with detailed comments explaining the code logic, time complexities, and usage examples.
Feel free to explore, contribute, or use the implementations for educational purposes.
